My personal scratch repository for solving leetcodes and investigating
algorithms and leetcode-style brain teasers.

I generally like to use python for these kinds of exercises because it is
terse and has most of the convenience functions for computer sciency type
exploration. However, I've done a fair amount in C++, Go, and Javascript for
fun and because I like those languages!

These were mostly written circa late 2020 - mid 2021, but I'm going to be adding
to it over time!
