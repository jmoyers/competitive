---
Given an array of integers, 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n (n = size of array), some elements
appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

Example:
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]

    Use the sign of the value stored at n - 1 to indicate whether we've seen a
    value. Goofy answer. In reality, you would just use a much smaller data type
    for the array and make a hash map if you valued your sanity at all.
