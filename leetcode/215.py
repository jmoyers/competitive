---
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth
largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ array's length.

        My intuition says that you can just use a min heap of size k
        to find the kth largest element.

        Since we don't have the whole list to heapify, building the
